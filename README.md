# random-color-generator

Project Description:

The Random Color Generator project is a web application that generates random colors and displays them on the web page. Each color is represented by a color container with its hexadecimal code displayed inside. The colors are generated dynamically using JavaScript and styled using CSS.
Concepts Covered:

    1. HTML Structure: Setting up the basic structure of the web page using HTML.
    2. CSS Styling: Styling HTML elements using CSS, including layout, colors, fonts, and borders.
    3. DOM Manipulation: Dynamically creating and modifying HTML elements using JavaScript.
    4. Event Handling: Triggering JavaScript functions in response to events, such as page load or button clicks.
    5. Randomization: Generating random colors using JavaScript's Math functions.
    6. Looping: Using loops to iterate over elements and perform actions repetitively.
    7. Modularization: Separating concerns by keeping HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code in separate files.
    8. Document Object Model (DOM): Accessing and manipulating the DOM to interact with HTML elements.

By working on this project, you'll gain hands-on experience with web development concepts and deepen your understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
